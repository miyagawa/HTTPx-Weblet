NAME
    HTTPx::Weblet - HTTP::Engine-like request and response objects for PSGI

DESCRIPTION
    HTTPx::Weblet is a toolkit that contains HTTP::Engine-like Request and
    Response for PSGI web applications. This is an *old* implementation of
    how Plack::Request was written, based on HTTP::Engine::Request and
    HTTP::Engine::Response.

    New middleware authors and web application framework authors are
    recommended to take a look and upgrade to the latest Plack::Request.
